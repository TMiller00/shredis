Learning how Redis works

## About The Project

I wanted to learn how Redis works, so I decided to build some of its implementation. The initial phase of this involves me following [Ahmed Ammar's](https://github.com/ahmedash95) excellent [Build Redis From Scratch](https://www.build-redis-from-scratch.dev/en/introduction) series, which I highly recommend. Currently, only a limited set of commands has been implemented, but more will be coming."
